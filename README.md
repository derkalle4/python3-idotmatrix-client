## About The Project

This repository aims to reverse engineer the [iDotMatrix](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tech.idotmatrix&pli=1) Android App for pixel screen displays like [this one on Aliexpress](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005006105517779.html). The goal is to be able to control multiple pixel screen displays via a GUI, an Rest API and the command line.

The initial reason for this project was to have a foundation to update one or multiple pixel displays during live streams on Twitch or other platforms where one can use this to further automate interactions with the audience. Please let us know if you're using this to do so :)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps:

### Prerequisites

Please install the following for your OS:

* Latest version of Python (Python3)


#### For windows

The `build.ps1` script automatically handles setting up the python virtual environment and a shortcut to the GUI. Powershell scripts can be opened by right clicking them and clicking "Run with PowerShell", or by nagivating to them in a PowerShell terminal and writing their filename as a command.

If you want to use the `.sh` scripts included in this repo on in Windows, you will need `msys2` or `git bash`.
The Python CLI program can be used without the `.sh` scripts in plain powershell/cmd, by manually opening the VENV like so:

```ps1
git clone https://github.com/derkalle4/python3-idotmatrix-client.git
cd python3-idotmatrix-client
pwd 				# Make sure that this is the path to your copy of this repository. 
				# If its not, navigate to it with cd, or shift-right-click the folder and click "open in powershell".
python3 -m venv venv  		# Creates the venv, not necessary if you've used the build.ps1 script.
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  	# Opens the venv. Omit ".ps1" if you're using cmd.
python3 -m pip install .\	# Downloads requirements from pyproject.toml
python3 -m pip install pyqt5	# Only necessary for the GUI
python3 .\app.py -h		# Replace -h with your commandline arguments
```





### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/derkalle4/python3-idotmatrix-client.git
```

2. `cd` to it

```sh
cd python3-idotmatrix-client
```

3. Create virtual environment and install all dependencies
    
```sh
./create_venv.sh
```

* This can alternatively be done with the automated venv & GUI setup script for Windows Powershell

```ps1
.\build.ps1
# This script automatically sets up the virtual environment and a shortcut to the GUI.
# You can alternately open it by right clicking the file in Windows Explorer and choosing "Run with powershell".
```





## Usage

If you used the ./create_venv.sh you should use this command to run the app:

```sh
./run_in_venv.sh <YOUR_COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS>
```

If you have manually opened the virtual environment, or are not using a virtual environment, the same can be accomplished with the following:

```sh
python3 .\app.py <YOUR_COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS>
```

#### command line arguments

##### --address (required for all commands except "scan")

Specifies the address of the pixel display device. Use "auto" to use the first available device (automatically looking for IDM-* devices in range).

./run_in_venv.sh --address 00:11:22:33:44:ff --scoreboard 21-12
```

##### --image

Wether to enable the image display mode or not. Set to true show an image or false to hide.

```sh
./run_in_venv.sh --address 00:11:22:33:44:ff --image true
```

###### --set-image

Path to an image to display on the device without further processing. This must match your display pixel size (e.g. demo_16.png for the 16x16 variant). See --process-image for more information on how to process a larger (or smaller) image!

If you do not want to process the image: when using Gimp I had to export the file to a 32x32 pixel PNG (for my 32x32 Pixel Display) and disable all features except the "save resolution" feature to save time when sending the image to the device. Every kind of metadata makes the image bigger and because we only can send around 20bytes at once this can certainly increase the transfer time!

The [Demo PNG](https://opengameart.org/content/pixel-art-practice) was downloaded from OpenGameArt.org.

```sh
./run_in_venv.sh --address 00:11:22:33:44:ff --image true --set-image ./images/demo_16.png
./run_in_venv.sh --address 00:11:22:33:44:ff --image true --set-image ./images/demo_32.png
./run_in_venv.sh --address 00:11:22:33:44:ff --image true --set-image ./images/demo_64.png
```

###### --process-image

If specified it will process the given image. If used, the Python3 library Pillow will be utilized to convert the given image to a PNG with the given amount of pixels (e.g. 32 for 32x32 or 16 for 16x16 pixels). Technically you could use all kind of sizes and variations of images. Keep in mind: processing could take some time depending on your computer. In my tests the given demo.png file takes around 1 second without processing and three seconds with processing.

```sh
./run_in_venv.sh --address 00:11:22:33:44:ff --image true --set-image ./images/demo_512.png --process-image 32
```

##### --set-gif

Path to an GIF to display on the device. See --process-gif for more information! The [Demo GIF](https://opengameart.org/content/animated-pixel-torch) was downloaded from OpenGameArt.org.

```sh
./run_in_venv.sh --address 00:11:22:33:44:ff --set-gif ./images/demo.gif
```

###### --process-gif

If specified it will process the given image. If used, the Python3 library Pillow will be utilized to convert the given image to a GIF with the given amount of pixels (e.g. 32 for 32x32 or 16 for 16x16 pixels). Technically you could use all kind of sizes for the GIF. Keep in mind: processing could take some time depending on your computer and using larger GIFs may result in a bad image quality. You should hand-craft your GIFs in the correct format for best results!

```sh
./run_in_venv.sh --address 00:11:22:33:44:ff --set-gif ./images/demo.gif --process-gif 32
```

##### --set-text

Sets a given text to the display. The [Demo Font](https://www.fontspace.com/rain-font-f22577) was downloaded from fontspace.com and is licensed open source (see font folder or link for details).

```sh
./run_in_venv.sh --address 00:11:22:33:44:ff --set-text "Hello World"
```

###### --text-size

Sets the size of the text.

```sh
./run_in_venv.sh --address 00:11:22:33:44:ff --set-text "Hello World" --text-size 10
```

###### --text-mode

Sets the mode of the text.

```sh
./run_in_venv.sh --address 00:11:22:33:44:ff --set-text "Hello World" --text-mode 1
```

###### --text-speed

Sets the speed of the text.

```sh
./run_in_venv.sh --address 00:11:22:33:44:ff --set-text "Hello World" --text-speed 50
```

###### --text-color-mode

Sets the color mode of the text.

```sh
./run_in_venv.sh --address 00:11:22:33:44:ff --set-text "Hello World" --text-color-mode 1
```

###### --text-color

Sets the color of the text.

```sh
./run_in_venv.sh --address 00:11:22:33:44:ff --set-text "Hello World" --text-color 255-255-255
```

###### --text-bg-mode

Sets the background mode of the text.

```sh
./run_in_venv.sh --address 00:11:22:33:44:ff --set-text "Hello World" --text-bg-mode 1
```

###### --text-bg-color

Sets the background color of the text.

```sh
./run_in_venv.sh --address 00:11:22:33:44:ff --set-text "Hello World" --text-bg-color 0-0-255
```

### External tools

To create compilations of images or videos, external tools like https://ezgifs.com/ can be used to compile a single GIF that can be uploaded.
There's also an internal helper script for Windows to convert and compile all images and videos in a folder: `/windows_scripts/resize_and_compile_all.ps1`
The above script is for Powershell, but at its core it just uses two small ImageMagick commands, which you can look at and use on any plataform.


## GUI

### Run Methods
You can run the GUI uncompiled with python, or you can build an executible with Pyinstaller.

#### Method 1) Run via Python
* Open terminal at ```/python3-idotmatrix-client```
* Run ```pip install pyqt5```
* Run ```py gui.py```

#### Method 2) Build and Run using PyInstaller

## Troubleshooting

### Can't find device ID 

Make sure that bluetooth is on, and that the iDotMatrix display is on and within range.

One thing that can cause this issue is an instance of Python running the script in the background, especially for the GUI.
After quitting open instances of this program, open up the task manager for your platform, and see if you can find and kill a task starting with "Python", before trying to use this program again.

If that doesn't work, try restarting your computer and disconnect/reconnect the iDotMatrix display from power.

If all else fails, open an issue in GitHub.
